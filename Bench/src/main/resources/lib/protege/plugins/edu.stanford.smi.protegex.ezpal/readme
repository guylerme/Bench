EZPal Tab System Requirements
-----------------------------

1. You must have the PAL Tabs installed (the PAL Tabs are bundled with the 
   "full" installation of Protege).

2. You must include the "template.pprj" project (located in the 
   "<protege-install-dir>/plugins/edu.stanford.smi.protegex.ezpal/doc" 
   directory) in your project.  This step has to be performed before you can 
   configure Protege to show the EZPal Tab.
