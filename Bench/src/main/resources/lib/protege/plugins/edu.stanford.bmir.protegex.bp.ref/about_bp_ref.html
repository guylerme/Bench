<strong>BioPortal Reference Plugin</strong><br><br>

<p>
The BioPortal Reference Plugin allows a user to <b>insert references to terms, classes, etc. from external ontologies and terminologies</b> stored in the
<a href="http://bioportal.bioontology.org">BioPortal ontology repository</a> into his or her own ontology without the need to import the external ontology.
The plugin allows the easy navigation from the domain ontology in Protege to the external ontology by simply clicking on the generated hyperlink of
a reference. The hyperlink will take the user directly into BioPortal to the referenced term. The user may also search BioPortal for alternative terms.
<br /><br />
The plugin is configurable and works with Protege OWL, RDF, Frames, client-server and all backends of Protege.
<br /><br />
The plugin is a slot widget that can be attached to any object or annotation property in OWL, or any slot with value type instance, class or any in Frames.
