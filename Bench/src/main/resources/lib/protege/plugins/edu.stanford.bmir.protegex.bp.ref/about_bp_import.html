<strong>BioPortal Import Plugin</strong><br><br>

<p>
The BioPortal Import Plugin allows the user to <b>import classes or entire class trees from external ontologies</b> stored in the
<a href="http://bioportal.bioontology.org">BioPortal ontology repository</a>.

The BioPortal Import plugin is added as an additional button on the OWL Classes Tab in Protege-OWL.

<br /><br />
The basic <b>steps</b> in using the plugin are to:
<ol>
<li>browse through all the BioPortal ontologies (except remote ones) and select which one to import classes from</li>
<li>select one or more classes to import from the BioPortal ontology</li>
<li>configure the import options (properties and metadata to import, etc.)</li>
<li>import them as subclasses of the selected class in the local ontology.</li>
</ol>

The plugin uses the RESTful services provided by BioPortal to allow the user to browse through the latest versions of all
BioPortal ontologies. The user can view the classes of the selected ontology in an expandable tree format, 
and also view the properties of each class.
<br /><br />
The plugin is configurable and works with Protege-OWL.
