the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property
rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to
Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement
of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to

            <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA"
 style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">Commercial distributors of
software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users,
business partners and the like. While this license is intended to
facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
manner which does not create potential liability for other
Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial
Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and
costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other
legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
expense. </span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA"
 style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">For example, a Contributor
might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X.
That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial
Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related
to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if
a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result,
the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. </span></p>

patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent

            </span></b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA"
 style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">Commercial distributors of
software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users,
business partners and the like. While this license is intended to
facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a
manner which does not create potential liability for other
Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a
commercial product offering, such Contributor ("Commercial
Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other
Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages and
costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other
legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified
Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this
section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or
alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an
Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial
Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor
in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
expense. </span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA"
 style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">For example, a Contributor
might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X.
That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial
Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related
to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if
a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result,
the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages. </span></p>

license
document, but changing it is not allowed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">[This is the first
released
version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as the successor of the GNU
Library
Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]</span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 8pt;">Preamble</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">The licenses for
most
software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.
By
contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee
your
freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is
free
for all its users. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">This license, the
Lesser
General Public License, applies to some specially designated software
packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and
other
authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you
first
think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary General
Public
License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on
the
explanations below. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">When we speak of
free
software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General
Public
Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute
copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that
you
receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
the
software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
informed
that you can do these things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">To protect your
rights, we
need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these
rights or
to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to
certain
responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if
you
modify it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">For example, if
you
distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must
give
the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that
they,
too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with
the
library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
that they
can relink them with the library after making changes to the library
and
recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">We protect your
rights with
a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you
this
license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the
library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">To protect each
distributor,
we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free
library.
Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the
recipients
should know that what they have is not the original version, so that
the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced
by others. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Finally, software
patents
pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We wish to
make
sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free
program by
obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we
insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent
with the full freedom of use specified in this license. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Most GNU software,
including
some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License.
This
license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain
designated
libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public
License. We
use this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">When a program is
linked
with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the
combination
of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the
original
library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such
linking
only if the entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser
General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the
library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">We call this
license the
"Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect the
user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other
free software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free
programs.
These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public
License
for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in
certain
special circumstances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">For example, on
rare
occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible
use of
a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve
this,
non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent
case is
that a free library does the same job as widely used non-free
libraries. In
this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">In other cases,
permission
to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater
number of
people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to
use the
GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the
whole
GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Although the
Lesser General
Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure
that
the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom
and the
wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the
Library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">The precise terms
and
conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close
attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and
a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived from
the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in
order to
run. </span></p>
<h3><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 8pt;">TERMS </span><span
 lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 8pt;">AND</span><span lang="EN-CA"
 style="font-size: 8pt;">
CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION </span><span lang="EN-CA"
 style="font-size: 8pt;">AND</span><span lang="EN-CA"
 style="font-size: 8pt;"> MODIFICATION</span></h3>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">0.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> This License Agreement
applies to
any software library or other program which contains a notice placed by
the
copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed
under
the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this
License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">A "library" means
a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be
conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">The "Library",
below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
distributed
under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the
Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a
work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another
language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">"Source code" for
a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to
it. For
a library, complete source code means all the source code for all
modules it
contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the
scripts used
to control compilation and installation of the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Activities other
than
copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License;
they
are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library
is not
restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
contents
constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
Library
in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the
Library
does and what the program that uses the Library does. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">1.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> You may copy and
distribute verbatim
copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any
medium,
provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy
an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and
distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">You may charge a
fee for the
physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer
warranty
protection in exchange for a fee. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">2.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> You may modify your copy
or copies
of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the
Library,
and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of
Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">a) The modified
work must
itself be a software library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">b) You must cause
the files
modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files
and the
date of any change.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">c) You must cause
the whole
of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the
terms of
this License. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">d) If a facility
in the
modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied
by an
application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument
passed
when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to
ensure
that, in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the
facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose
remains
meaningful. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">(For example, a
function in
a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
well-defined
independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that
any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must be
optional:
if the application does not supply it, the square root function must
still
compute square roots.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">These requirements
apply to
the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are
not
derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent
and
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
apply to
those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the
Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
License,
whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and
thus to
each and every part regardless of who wrote it. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Thus, it is not
the intent
of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written
entirely
by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution
of derivative or collective works based on the Library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">In addition, mere
aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library
(or with
a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium
does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">3.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> You may opt to apply the
terms of
the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a
given copy
of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer
to this
License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License,
version
2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of
the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that
version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these
notices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Once this change
is made in
a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU
General
Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works
made from
that copy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">This option is
useful when
you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is
not a
library. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">4.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> You may copy and
distribute the
Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object
code or
executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that
you
accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code,
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
a medium
customarily used for software interchange. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">If distribution of
object
code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then
offering
equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies
the
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties
are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">5.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> A program that contains
no
derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with
the
Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that
uses
the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of
the
Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">However, linking a
"work
that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that is a
derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the
Library), rather
than a "work that uses the library". The executable is therefore
covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
such
executables. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">When a "work that
uses
the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the
Library,
the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library
even
though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially
significant
if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself
a
library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by
law. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">If such an object
file uses
only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and
small
macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then
the use
of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally
a
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions
of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Otherwise, if the
work is a
derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the
work
under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also
fall
under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the
Library
itself. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">6.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> As an exception to the
Sections
above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses the Library"
with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library,
and
distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the
terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for
debugging such modifications. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">You must give
prominent
notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and
that the
Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy
of this
License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you
must
include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a
reference
directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one
of these
things: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">a) Accompany the
work with
the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library
including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be
distributed
under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with
the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses the
Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can
modify
the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
the
modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the
contents of
definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to
recompile the
application to use the modified definitions.) </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">b) Use a suitable
shared
library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is
one
that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the
user's
computer system, rather than copying library functions into the
executable, and
(2) will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
the user
installs one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible
with the
version that the work was made with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">c) Accompany the
work with a
written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user
the
materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than
the cost
of performing this distribution. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">d) If distribution
of the
work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer
equivalent
access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">e) Verify that the
user has
already received a copy of these materials or that you have already
sent this
user a copy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">For an executable,
the
required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any
data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from
it.
However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need
not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or
binary form)
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the
executable. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">It may happen that
this
requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary
libraries
that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a
contradiction means
you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that
you
distribute. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">7.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> You may place library
facilities
that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library
together
with other library facilities not covered by this License, and
distribute such
a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work
based
on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and
provided that you do these two things: </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">a) Accompany the
combined
library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined
with any
other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of
the
Sections above. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">b) Give prominent
notice
with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based
on the
Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form
of the
same work.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">8.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> You may not copy, modify,
sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly
provided
under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
link
with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically
terminate your
rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,
or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">9.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> You are not required to
accept this
License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you
permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.
These
actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
and
conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works
based on
it. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">10.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> Each time you
redistribute the
Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link
with or
modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not
impose
any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
granted
herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties with
this License. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">11.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> If, as a consequence of a
court
judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason
(not
limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by
court
order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License,
they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you
cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License
and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would
not
permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who
receive
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy
both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution
of the
Library. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">If any portion of
this
section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular
circumstance, the
balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole
is
intended to apply in other circumstances. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">It is not the
purpose of
this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property
right
claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the
sole
purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution
system
which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that
system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up
to the
author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software
through
any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">This section is
intended to
make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest
of this
License. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">12.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> If the distribution
and/or use of
the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by
copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
Library
under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution
limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or
among
countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates
the
limitation as if written in the body of this License. </span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">13.</span></strong><span
 style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;"> The Free Software
Foundation may
publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General Public
License from
time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the
present
version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial;">Each version is
given a
distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version
number of
this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have
the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
or of
any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library
does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version

<h3><span lang="EN-CA" style="font-size: 9pt;">4. COMMERCIAL
DISTRIBUTION </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">Commercial
distributors of
software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users,
business partners and the like. While this license is intended to
facilitate
the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the
Program in
a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not
create
potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor
includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any
losses, damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party
against the
Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions
of such
Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the
Program in a
commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not
apply to
any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual
property
infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)
promptly
notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)
allow the
Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial
Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations.
The
Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own
expense. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt; font-family: Arial;">For example, a
Contributor
might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X.
That
Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial
Contributor
then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product
X, those
performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's
responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor
would have
to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those
performance
claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to
pay any
damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.

Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In
addition,
if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including
a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program
itself
(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)
infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights

If all
Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to
cease
use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.
However,
Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted
by
Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive. </span></p>

example,
a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
offering,
Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers
warranties
related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
Contributors
related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
requires any
other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
Contributor
must pay those damages. </span></p>

In
addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity

the
Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other
software or

reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this
