<strong>PAL Constraints and Queries Tabs</strong><br><br>

PAL, the Prot&eacute;g&eacute; Axiom Language, is a superset of first-order logic which has two purposes. PAL 
can be used to express constraints about a knowledge base, and it can be used to make logical queries about the 
contents of a knowledge base. These two uses correspond to two tabs: the PAL Constraints Tab and the PAL Queries 
Tab.<br><br>

The PAL Constraints Tab is a front-end for the constraint system. This tab allows a user to create, browse, and 
modify constraints in the knowledge base, and to evaluate constraints (either as a group or individually).<br><br>

The PAL Queries Tab is a front-end for the query system. This tab allows a user to
create, browse, and modify queries in the knowledge base, and to evaluate queries (either
as a group or individually).<br><br>
